    "# Part 1 - Querying data using SQL commands\n",
    "Since you already know quite a bit about querying a SQL database, this is the easiest way to get data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps are \n",
    "1. *Connect to the database*. This may require some setup work depending on database type (SQLite, MS SQL, Teradata, etc).  Often times an intermediate piece of software called a database driver is required. This piece of software knows how to make a connection to the database server and send your SQL commands to the database and return the results to you. For SQLite, the driver is built-into Python and so there is no extra software to setup other than the standard Python libraries.\n",
    "2. *Create a cursor* that can be used to send commands to the server. A database cursor is a pointer that moves around the database and points to the data you want to retrieve from the database.\n",
    "3. *Execute a command*. Once the setup has been completed, we can finally execute a command. A command is the SQL statement you want to be sent to the database.  If the command returns data (as in a SELECT statement), then the cursor will point to the data that is to be returned (but keep in mind, only 1 row of data at a time).\n",
