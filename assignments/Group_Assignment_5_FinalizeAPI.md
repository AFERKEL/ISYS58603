# Group Assignment 5 - Finalize the API

## Goal
The purpose of this assignment is to stamp your API complete for use by someone else.  You will need to ensure that your API is documented and that it is easy to use.

## Deliverable
Submit the GitHub URL of your repository containing all code, dependencies, and a README with instructions for running the application. The application will be evaluated based on the effective use of the API, correctness, completeness (utilization of various API endpoints), and creativity.

***<span style="color:red">NOTE:</span>be sure to TAG the commit that you want to be graded with `v4.0`, `GA5` or similar so that it's clear what you want to be evaluated***
## Background
Remember, the API you've built has several purposes, such as data exchange, modularity, and reusability. Think about how these aspects can influence your front-end. For example, if your API focuses on data exchange, you might build a data visualization front-end.
