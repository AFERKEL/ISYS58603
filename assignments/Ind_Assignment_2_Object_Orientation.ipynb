    "# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your second individual assignment, where we delve into the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. In this assignment, you will embark on a journey to transform how you think about solving problems in Python—shifting from a procedural approach to one that models real-world entities and their interactions as objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to structure software in a way that is both modular and scalable. By thinking in terms of objects, you can create systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend. In this assignment, you will not only learn how to create and manipulate objects in Python, but you will also explore how these objects can be organized into classes, how they can inherit and extend behaviors, and how you can leverage design patterns to solve common problems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you will have achieved the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mastered OOP Fundamentals**: You'll start with the basics of classes and objects, understanding how they serve as the building blocks of Python programs.\n",
    "2. **Developed Object-Oriented Thinking**: You will practice designing systems that encapsulate functionality within objects, thinking about how these objects interact to perform tasks.\n",
    "3. **Explored OOP Design Patterns**: You will be introduced to common design patterns that solve recurring problems in software design, enhancing your ability to write clean and reusable code.\n",
    "4. **Applied Advanced OOP Techniques**: Finally, you will implement more advanced concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, solidifying your understanding of how to create robust, scalable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Importance of Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the tasks in this assignment, remember that OOP is not just about writing code—it's about modeling the complexities of the real world in a way that is both intuitive and powerful. The exercises are designed to help you think critically about how to structure your code and apply best practices that will serve you well in this course and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let’s Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your time to explore each concept and exercise, and don't hesitate to revisit the materials provided in class if you need a refresher. This assignment is a key step in your journey towards becoming proficient in Python and OOP, so embrace the challenge and enjoy the process of learning!\n"

    "# Try it– Developing Classes and Manipulating Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to provide you with hands-on experience in creating and manipulating objects in Python using object-oriented programming concepts. You will gain proficiency in defining classes, creating instances, setting attributes, and implementing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first step is to create the **class** - a definition of what an **object** of that class will look like.  The class is a blueprint for the object.  The object is the actual instance of the class that you will be working with.  Classes define the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the object will have.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So just like we have an idea of what a car is, we can define a class for a car that has attributes like *make*, *model*, *year*, and *color*, and methods like *start*, *stop*, and *drive*.  The object is the actual instance of the class that has specific values for those attributes, in this case the actual car in my driveway, a 2015 Honda Civic, white.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 - Object Instantiation\n",
    "Here we are going to play around with creating instances of the class (```Person```) that have been defined for you and then manipulating them after they are created."

    "## Step 2 - Class inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and methods from the existing class, known as a superclass. This allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes that model real-world relationships.  For instance, we could have a class `Person` and a subclass `Student` that inherits from `Person`.  The `Student` class would have all the attributes and methods of the `Person` class, but could also have additional attributes and methods that are specific to a student.  Let's see how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to get a little more specific and define `Instructor`, which is a special kind of `Person` that happens to teach `Course(s)` at our university.  The following code snippet defines the `Instructor` class and the `Course` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instructor` has the following attributes:\n",
    "- `first_name` (inherits from Person)\n",
    "- `last_name` (inherits from Person)\n",
    "- `id` (inherits from Person)\n",
    "- `courses` (a list of courses the instructor teaches)\n",
    "- `first_year_teaching` (the first year the instructor started teaching at the university)\n",
    "\n",
    "and the following functions\n",
    "- `add_course(course)` (adds a course to the list of courses the instructor teaches)\n",
    "- `remove_course(course)` (removes a course from the list of courses the instructor teaches)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: While not required by syntax, it is a good practice to capitalize the first letter of each word in a class name.  It's helpful to differentiate classes from variables and functions which are typically lowercase.\n",
    "**NOTE2**: In Python, we can \"hide\" attributes by prepending them with an underscore. This is a convention to let other developers know that they should not be directly accessed.  Instead, we should use a method to access or modify these attributes.  This is a form of encapsulation, which is a key concept in OOP.  You see in the instructor class `_courses_teaching`, we don't want users of the class manipulating this list directly, but rather we want them to use the `add_course()`, `remove_course()`, `get_courses()` functions instead."
