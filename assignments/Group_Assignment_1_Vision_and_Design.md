# Group Assignment 1 - Vision and Design

## Goal
Develop a project charter to highlight the goals of the project that is about to undertaken.  In addition, the group will develop a conceptual architecture.  This high-level architecture will outline the various entities that are being managed in the system.

## Deliverables (20 pts)
* Project Charter (10 pts)
* Entity Design / Conceptual Architecture (10 pts)

## Instructions
Knowing where you are going and being able to convey that direction to others is vital to a successful project.  For this first group assignment, the group will develop a vision statement – a reminder and a standing stone which will guide decisions as the project moves along.  Having a strong vision can be a compelling motivator for team members, stakeholders and possible investors.  The scope portion of the document ensures that the important aspects of the project are considered and diversions are caught early.
Once the vision has been set and the team is clear on the project’s direction from a business perspective, it’s important to set the technical boundaries of the project.  A conceptual (or logical) diagram of entities involved in the system can help to keep the technical team on the same page.  Highlighting the key data that will be made available to the API and the type of data that will be stored in the database can make evident any design difficulties early in the process before getting too far into the implementation.
Turn in a single PDF document which has the project charter and the entity design (which will serve as your design document).  You may add additional information that you feel will be valuable to convey the vision and to keep the project on track (i.e. use cases, requirements doc).

The [example](Sample_Charter_and_Design.docx) attached is based on the case study with regard to Geocaching outings (derived from [Systems Analysis and Design, Kendall and Kendall](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Analysis-Design-Kenneth-Kendall/dp/0133023443)).  In short, Wayne (the customer) wants to have a geocaching application with the features described in this project charter.  

You should cover all the aspects represented here.  Remove the sample text and instructions before submitting.  Remember to ensure your deliverables are professional and neat.  (proper headers/footers, consistent font, use of built in styles, etc.)
